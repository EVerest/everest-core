  Errors for Connector Lock

  The following error types give more details about connector lock errors.
  You should consider setting a MREC_1_ConnectorLockFailure to indicate a generic lock failure with an MREC error code as well
  as one of the more detailed but custom error codes to specify the reason:

  All error codes that begin with MREC needs to be implemented to fulfill the Minimum Required Error Codes defined by the ChargeX consortium:

      How should that be implemented? We can only find out about locking on the EVSE side,
      so we will use this error to report EVSE side lock failures. It is probably a mistake in the MREC definition.
