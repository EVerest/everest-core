  Errors for Isolation Monitor

  Note that actual isolation faults should just be reported as resistance values,
  EvseManager will interpret them according to the limits given in the norm and stop charging.

  This is only to report device errors to indicate valid isolation resistance measurements etc
  are no longer possible.
