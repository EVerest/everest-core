  Errors for DC power supply
 
  Except for VendorWarning, all error codes will stop the charging session.
  During all errors, follow the commands for setMode and setVoltageCurrent from EvseManager. If they cannot be sent to the hardware, cache the last values received.
  Once the PSU is back on-line (e.g. after a CommunicationFault), set the last mode and voltage/current values and only after that clear the error.
errors:
  - name: CommunicationFault
    description: >-
      The communication to the hardware or underlying driver is lost or has errors.
  - name: HardwareFault
    description: The hardware reported a fault
  - name: OverTemperature
    description: >-
      The hardware shut down because of over temperature. This should not be used if the power supply can handle temperature reduction by reducing output power,
      in this case update the capabilities as needed. 
  - name: UnderTemperature
    description: The hardware cannot operate because it is too cold
  - name: UnderVoltageAC
    description: The AC input voltage is too low
  - name: OverVoltageAC
    description: The AC input voltage is too high
  - name: UnderVoltageDC
    description: The DC output voltage is too low
  - name: OverVoltageDC
    description: The DC output voltage is too high
  - name: OverCurrentAC
    description: The AC input current is too high
  - name: OverCurrentDC
    description: The DC output current it too high
  - name: VendorError
    description: >-
      Vendor specific error code. Will stop charging session.
  - name: VendorWarning
    description: >-
      Vendor specific error code. Charging may continue.
