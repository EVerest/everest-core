This module implements logic to distribute power to energy nodes based on
energy requests.
One of its central ideas is to represent the energy system for which power is
distributed as an energy tree containing energy nodes.
This enables the representation of arbitrarily complex configurations of
physical and logical components within the targeted energy system.

Please see :doc:`Energy Management in EVerest </explanation/energymanagement/index>`
for a detailed explanation of the concepts behind this module.
