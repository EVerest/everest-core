  switch_3ph1ph_while_charging_mode:
    description: >-
      If supported by BSP in capabilities to switch between three phases and one phase and config option three_phases is set to true,
      this controls the algorithm:
        - Never: Do not use 1ph/3ph switching even if supported by the BSP
        - Oneway: Only switch from 3ph to 1ph if power is not enough, but never switch back to 3ph for a session.
        - Both: Switch in both directions, i.e. from 3ph to 1ph and back to 3ph if available power changes
    type: string
    enum:
      - Never
      - Oneway
      - Both
    default: Never
  switch_3ph1ph_max_nr_of_switches_per_session:
    description: >-
      Limit the maximum number of switches between 1ph and 3ph per charging session.
      Set to 0 for no limit.
    type: integer
    default: 0
  switch_3ph1ph_switch_limit_stickyness:
    description: >-
      If the maximum number of switches between 1ph and 3ph is reached, select what should happen:
        - SinglePhase: Switch to 1ph mode
        - ThreePhase: Switch to 3ph mode
        - DontChange: Stay in the mode it is currently in
    type: string
    enum:
      - SinglePhase
      - ThreePhase
      - DontChange
    default: DontChange
  switch_3ph1ph_power_hysteresis_W:
    description: >-
      Power based hysteresis in Watt. If set to 200W for example,
      the hysteresis for PWM based charging will be 4.2kW to 4.4kW.
      Actual values will depend on configured nominal AC voltage, and they may be different for
      PWM vs ISO based charging in the future.
    type: integer
    default: 200
  switch_3ph1ph_time_hysteresis_s:
    description: >-
      Time based hysteresis. It will only switch to 3 phases if the condition to select 3 phases
      is stable for the configured number of seconds. It will always switch to 1ph mode without
      waiting for this delay.
      Set to 0 to disable time based hysteresis.
    type: integer
    default: 600
