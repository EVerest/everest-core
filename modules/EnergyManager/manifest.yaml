      If supported by BSP in capabilities to switch between three phases and one phase and config option three_phases is set to true,
      this controls the algorithm:
        - Never: Do not use 1ph/3ph switching even if supported by the BSP
        - Oneway: Only switch from 3ph to 1ph if power is not enough, but never switch back to 3ph for a session.
        - Both: Switch in both directions, i.e. from 3ph to 1ph and back to 3ph if available power changes
    type: string
    enum:
      - Never
      - Oneway
      - Both
    default: Never
