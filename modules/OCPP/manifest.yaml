description: A OCPP charge point / charging station module, currently targeting OCPP-J 1.6
config:
  ChargePointConfigPath:
    description: >- 
      Path to the ocpp configuration file. Libocpp defines a JSON schema for this file. Please refer to the documentation
      of libocpp for more information about the configuration options.  
    type: string
    default: ocpp-config.json
  UserConfigPath:
    description: >-
      Path to the file of the OCPP user config. The user config is used as an overlay for the original config defined
      by the ChargePointConfigPath. Any changes to configuration keys turned out internally or by the CSMS will be 
      written to the user config file.
    type: string
    default: user_config.json
  DatabasePath:
    description: >-
      Path to the persistent SQLite database directory. Please refer to the libocpp documentation for more information
      about the database and its structure.
    type: string
    default: /tmp/ocpp_1_6_charge_point
  EnableExternalWebsocketControl:
    description: If true websocket can be disconnected and connected externally. This parameter is for debug and testing purposes.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  PublishChargingScheduleIntervalS:
    description:
      Interval in seconds in which charging schedules received from OCPP
      are be published over MQTT and signalled to connected modules. If the value
      is set to 0, charging schedules are only published when changed by CSMS
    type: integer
    default: 30
  PublishChargingScheduleDurationS:
    description: Duration in seconds that defines the duration of the requested charging schedules starting from now
    type: integer
    default: 600
  MessageLogPath:
    description: Path to directory where logs of all OCPP messages are written to
    type: string
    default: /tmp/everest_ocpp_logs
  MessageQueueResumeDelay:
    description: >-
      Time (seconds) to delay resuming the message queue after reconnecting. This parameter was introduced because
      some OCTT test cases require that the first message after a reconnect is sent by the CSMS.
    type: integer
    default: 0
