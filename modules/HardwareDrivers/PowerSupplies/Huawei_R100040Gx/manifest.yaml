  Driver for Huawei_R100040Gx ACDC power supply. Supports multiple stacked modules.
  This module never exits. If communication is lost to the power supply, a CommunicationFault is raised.
  The error is cleared once communication is back up again.
  The Linux can device (e.g. can0) should ideally be present and correctly configured when the module is started,
  but it also works if the device comes up later. Once it was up once, it should not disappear again.
  The PSU may be appear or disappear on the CAN bus itself any time.

  module_addresses:

      Module Addresses to use. Set to "" for auto detect (Uses all modules that reply to broadcast requests on this CAN bus).
      If multiple hardware addresses are listed (e.g. "120,121"), only those will be used. Current will be shared between them.

      Maximum current that the PSU module can deliver. When using multiple PSUs in parallel, this refers to the total current capability of all modules.
      Set to 0 to use hardware defaults.
    type: integer
    default: 0
  max_export_power_W:

      Maximum power that the PSU module can deliver. When using multiple PSUs in parallel, this refers to the total power capability of all modules.
