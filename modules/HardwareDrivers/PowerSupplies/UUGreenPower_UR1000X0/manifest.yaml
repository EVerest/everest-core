    description: >-
      Module Addresses to use. Set to "0" for broadcast. Make sure to connect only one PSU on the CAN bus in broadcast mode, otherwise
      it will charge at a too high current (as every module will produce the full current the EV requests!)
      If you have multiple PSUs, use individual addresses and list them comma separated, e.g. "1,2". Then it will share the current between
      these PSUs.
