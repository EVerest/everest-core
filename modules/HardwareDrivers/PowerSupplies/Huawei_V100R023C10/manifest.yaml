      Just publish the requested voltage and current to the power supply.
      This is a hack useful for testing in a SIL environment.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  HACK_use_ovm_while_cable_check:
    description: |
      Use the over voltage monitor while the cable check is running instead of the powermeter, e.g. when the powermeter is too slow.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  send_secure_goose:
    description: |
      Send secure GOOSE frames to the power supply.
      If set to false, the GOOSE frames are sent without a signature. If set to true, the outgoing GOOSE frames are signed.
      Note: This does not affect receiving GOOSE frames.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  allow_insecure_goose:
    description: |
      Allow receiving insecure GOOSE frames from the power supply.
      If set to false, the received GOOSE frames must be signed (the signature is only checked if verify_secure_goose is set to true).
      If set to true, the received GOOSE frames are not checked for a signature.
      Note: If verify_secure_goose is set to true, this setting is ignored.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  verify_secure_goose:
    description: |
      Verify the received GOOSE frames.
      If set to false, the received GOOSE frames are not verified.
      If set to true, the received GOOSE frames must be secure and the signature must be valid.
      Note: If this is set to true the allow_insecure_goose setting is ignored
    type: boolean
    default: true
