      Specifies in seconds after which time a retry of an upload or download on previous failure may be attempted.
    type: number
    default: 1
  ResetDelay:
    description: >-
      When receiving a reset request, then the actual execution can be delayed by this amount of time (given in seconds).
      This might be necessary, for example, when the reset request arrives via the network and the call acknowledgement
      should be given some time to travel the return path to the caller.
      Defaults to zero, which means that the reset is executed directly without delay.
