    type: boolean

  ac_hlc_use_5percent:
    description: >-
      Use 5 percent PWM signalling to try to enforce HLC on AC. Note that if EIM arrives before SLAC matching, we will
      fall back to nominal PWM charging. So most cars will never use HLC in this mode, especially on a free service
      where EIM is always available, but that is what ISO15118-2/-3 requires to be compliant - it wants to use HLC only
      for PnC and not for EIM.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  ac_enforce_hlc:
    description: >-
      Combine with 5percent option to really enforce HLC even with EIM. It is not ISO15118-2/-3 compliant as it waits
      for matching even if EIM is available before SLAC reaches matched state. On cars that do not support ISO15118 on
      AC this will take a very long time to timeout and fall back to basic nominal PWM charging, but it will eventually.

  hack_pause_imd_during_precharge:
    description: >-
      Disable IMD at the end of CableCheck and re-enable when current is flowing in CurrentDemand.
      Some DCDC power supplies do not start current flow when insulation measurement is active.
      Set to true to enable dirty workaround for some IMD hardware.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  hack_allow_bpt_with_iso2:
    description:

  hack_fix_hlc_integer_current_requests:
    description: >-
      Some cars request only integer ampere values during DC charging. For low power DC charging that 
      means that they charge a few hundred watts slower then needed. If enabled, this will charge at full power if the difference
      between EV requested current (integer) and HLC current limit is less then 1.0
    type: boolean
    default: false
  disable_authentication:
    description: >-
      Do not wait for authorization from Auth module, offer a free service. Start charging immediately after plug in.
      Do not use with Auth manager or OCPP, this option is only to allow charging with a standalone EvseManager that is not connected to an Auth manager.
