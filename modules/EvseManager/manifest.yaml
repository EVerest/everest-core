    type: boolean
    default: false
  ac_hlc_use_5percent:
    description: >-
      Use 5 percent PWM signalling to try to enforce HLC on AC. Note that if EIM arrives before SLAC matching, we will
      fall back to nominal PWM charging. So most cars will never use HLC in this mode, especially on a free service
      where EIM is always available, but that is what ISO15118-2/-3 requires to be compliant - it wants to use HLC only
      for PnC and not for EIM.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  ac_enforce_hlc:
    description: >-
      Combine with 5percent option to really enforce HLC even with EIM. It is not ISO15118-2/-3 compliant as it waits
      for matching even if EIM is available before SLAC reaches matched state. On cars that do not support ISO15118 on
      AC this will take a very long time to timeout and fall back to basic nominal PWM charging, but it will eventually.
