      Use 5 percent PWM signalling to try to enforce HLC on AC. Note that if EIM arrives before SLAC matching, we will
      fall back to nominal PWM charging. So most cars will never use HLC in this mode, especially on a free service
      where EIM is always available, but that is what ISO15118-2/-3 requires to be compliant - it wants to use HLC only
      for PnC and not for EIM.
    type: boolean

  ac_enforce_hlc:
    description: >-
      Combine with 5percent option to really enforce HLC even with EIM. It is not ISO15118-2/-3 compliant as it waits
      for matching even if EIM is available before SLAC reaches matched state. On cars that do not support ISO15118 on

  cable_check_wait_below_60V_before_finish:
    description: >-
      Switch off power supply and wait until output voltage drops below 60V before cable check is finished.
      Note: There are different versions of IEC 61851-23:2023 in the wild with the same version number but slightly different content.
      The IEC was correcting mistakes _after_ releasing the document initially without tagging a new version number.
      Some early versions require to wait for the output voltage to drop below 60V in CC.4.1.2 (last sentence).
      Later versions do not have that requirement. The later versions are correct and should be used according to IEC.
      Both settings (true and false) are compliant with the correct version of IEC 61851-23:2023.
      Set to true when:
        - the power supply has no active discharge, and lowering the voltage with no load takes a very long time. In this case
          this option usually helps to ramp the voltage down quickly by switching it off. It will be switched on again in precharge.
          Also, some EVs switch their internal relay on at a too high voltage when the voltage is ramped down directly from cablecheck voltage to precharge voltage,
          so true is the recommended default.
      Set to false when:
        - the power supply has active discharge and can ramp down quickly without a switch off (by just setting a lower target voltage).
          This may save a few seconds as it avoids unnecessary voltage down and up ramping.

      Some cars request only integer ampere values during DC charging. For low power DC charging that
      means that they charge a few hundred watts slower then needed. If enabled, this will charge at full power if the difference

      It is the responsibiltiy of the evse_board_support implementation to ensure the EV is capable of performing
      the switch. If it is not, the capabilities must set the supports_changing_phases_during_charging to false.

  state_F_after_fault_ms:
    description: >-
      Set state F after any fault that stops charging for the specified time in ms while in Charging mode (CX->F(300ms)->C1/B1).
      When a fault occurs in state B2, no state F is added (B2->B1 on fault).
      Some (especially older hybrid vehicles) may go into a permanent fault mode once they detect state F,
      in this case EVerest cannot recover the charging session if the fault is cleared.
      In this case you can set this parameter to 0, which will avoid to use state F in case of a fault
      and only disables PWM (C2->C1) while switching off power. This will violate IEC 61851-1:2017 however.
      The default is 300ms as the minimum suggested by IEC 61851-1:2017 Table A.5 (description) to be compliant.
      This setting is only active in BASIC charging mode.

  sleep_before_enabling_pwm_hlc_mode_ms:
    description: >- 
      Sleep before the PWM signal is updated in HLC mode. Teslas are really fast with sending the first slac packet after
      enabling PWM, so the sleep allows SLAC to be ready for it. Some EV testers have issues with a value >= 1000ms,
      although ISO15118 or IEC61851 does not specify a timeout.
