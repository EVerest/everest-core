# API module documentation
This module is responsible for providing a simple MQTT based API to EVerest internals

## Periodically published variables for each connected EvseManager
This module periodically publishes the following variables for each connected EvseManager.

### everest_api/connectors
This variable is published every second and contains an array of the connectors for which the api is available:
```
["evse_manager"]
```

The following documentation assumes that the only connector available is called "evse_manager".

### everest_api/evse_manager/var/datetime
This variable is published every second and contains a string representation of the current UTC datetime in RFC3339 format:
```
2022-10-11T16:18:57.746Z
```

### everest_api/evse_manager/var/hardware_capabilities
This variable is published every second and contains the hardware capabilities in the following format:
```json
    {
        "max_current_A_export":16.0,
        "max_current_A_import":32.0,
        "max_phase_count_export":3,
        "max_phase_count_import":3,
        "min_current_A_export":0.0,
        "min_current_A_import":6.0,
        "min_phase_count_export":1,
        "min_phase_count_import":1,
        "supports_changing_phases_during_charging":true
    }
```

### everest_api/evse_manager/var/session_info
This variable is published every second and contains a json object with information relating to the current charging session in the following format:
```json
    {
        "charged_energy_wh": 0,
        "charging_duration_s": 84,
        "datetime": "2022-10-11T16:48:35.747Z",
        "discharged_energy_wh": 0,
        "latest_total_w": 0.0,
        "state": "Unplugged",
        "active_permanent_faults": [],
        "active_errors": []
    }
```

Example with permanent faults being active:

```json
{
  "active_errors": [],
  "active_permanent_faults": [
    {
      "description": "The control pilot voltage is out of range.",
      "severity": "High",
      "type": "MREC14PilotFault"
    },
    {
      "description": "The vehicle is in an invalid mode for charging (Reported by IEC stack)",
      "severity": "High",
      "type": "MREC10InvalidVehicleMode"
    }
  ],
  "charged_energy_wh": 0,
  "charging_duration_s": 0,
  "datetime": "2024-01-15T14:58:15.172Z",
  "discharged_energy_wh": 0,
  "latest_total_w": 0,
  "state": "Preparing"
}
```

- **charged_energy_wh** contains the charged energy in Wh
- **charging_duration_s** contains the duration of the current charging session in seconds
- **datetime** contains a string representation of the current UTC datetime in RFC3339 format
- **discharged_energy_wh** contains the energy fed into the power grid by the EV in Wh
- **latest_total_w** contains the latest total power reading over all phases in Watt
- **state** contains the current state of the charging session, from a list of the following possible states:
    - Unplugged
    - Disabled
    - Preparing
    - Reserved
    - AuthRequired
    - WaitingForEnergy
    - Charging
    - ChargingPausedEV
    - ChargingPausedEVSE
    - Finished

- **active_permanent_faults** array of all active errors that are permanent faults (i.e. that block charging). If anything is set here it should be shown as an error to the user instead of showing the current state:
    - RCD_Selftest
    - RCD_DC
    - RCD_AC
    - VendorError
    - VendorWarning
    - ConnectorLockCapNotCharged
    - ConnectorLockUnexpectedOpen
    - ConnectorLockUnexpectedClose
    - ConnectorLockFailedLock
    - ConnectorLockFailedUnlock
    - MREC1ConnectorLockFailure
    - MREC2GroundFailure
    - MREC3HighTemperature
    - MREC4OverCurrentFailure
    - MREC5OverVoltage
    - MREC6UnderVoltage
    - MREC8EmergencyStop
    - MREC10InvalidVehicleMode
    - MREC14PilotFault
    - MREC15PowerLoss
    - MREC17EVSEContactorFault
    - MREC18CableOverTempDerate
    - MREC19CableOverTempStop
    - MREC20PartialInsertion
    - MREC23ProximityFault
    - MREC24ConnectorVoltageHigh
    - MREC25BrokenLatch
    - MREC26CutCable
    - DiodeFault
    - VentilationNotAvailable
    - BrownOut
    - EnergyManagement
    - PermanentFault
    - PowermeterTransactionStartFailed

- **active_errors** array of all active errors that do not block charging. This could be shown to the user but the current state should still be shown as it does not interfere with charging. The enum is the same as for active_permanent_faults.

### everest_api/evse_manager/var/limits

## Periodically published variables for OCPP

### everest_api/ocpp/var/connection_status
This variable is published every second and contains the connection status of the OCPP module.
If the OCPP module has not yet published its "is_connected" status or no OCPP module is configured "unknown" is published. Otherwise "connected" or "disconnected" are published.


## Commands and variables published in response
### everest_api/evse_manager/cmd/enable
Command to enable a connector on the EVSE. They payload should be a positive integer identifying the connector that should be enabled. If the payload is 0 the whole EVSE is enabled.

### everest_api/evse_manager/cmd/disable
Command to disable a connector on the EVSE. They payload should be a positive integer identifying the connector that should be disabled. If the payload is 0 the whole EVSE is disabled.

### everest_api/evse_manager/cmd/pause_charging
If any arbitrary payload is published to this topic charging will be paused by the EVSE.

### everest_api/evse_manager/cmd/resume_charging
If any arbitrary payload is published to this topic charging will be paused by the EVSE.

### everest_api/evse_manager/cmd/set_limit_amps
Command to set an amps limit for this EVSE that will be considered within the EnergyManager. This does not automatically imply that this limit will be set by the EVSE because the energymanagement might consider limitations from other sources, too. The payload can be a positive or negative number. 

### everest_api/evse_manager/cmd/set_limit_watts
Command to set a watt limit for this EVSE that will be considered within the EnergyManager. This does not automatically imply that this limit will be set by the EVSE because the energymanagement might consider limitations from other sources, too. The payload can be a positive or negative number.

### everest_api/evse_manager/cmd/force_unlock
Command to force unlock a connector on the EVSE. They payload should be a positive integer identifying the connector that should be unlocked. If the payload is empty or cannot be converted to an integer connector 1 is assumed.
