# Api Serialization Test Autogenerator

This script generates generic tests based on the API.hpp files in the given include directory.

The tests try to serialize and deserialize the api structs and check wether the result matches the original.

The test files are automatically generated by cmake and are updated every time the API.hpp files change.

# disable.csv

If the test generation for any struct or enum needs to be disabled, it can be listed here with the following scheme:

<module name>/API.hpp,<Struct/Enum name>

Note that this may also affect the testing of dependent structs, if there are any.
To disable structs and enums that are needed for the automatic generation of other structs, there need to be changes made to the AccrossFileGenerator.
