/* NFC device HAL for NCI-based NFC controllers.
 *
 * This HAL allows NCI silicon vendors to make use
 * of the core NCI stack in Android for their own silicon.
 *
 * The responibilities of the NCI HAL implementation
 * are as follows:
 *
 * - Implement the transport to the NFC controller
 * - Implement each of the HAL methods specified below as applicable to their silicon
 * - Pass up received NCI messages from the controller to the stack
 *
 * A simplified timeline of NCI HAL method calls:
 * 1) Core NCI stack calls open()
 * 2) Core NCI stack executes CORE_RESET and CORE_INIT through calls to write()
 * 3) Core NCI stack calls core_initialized() to allow HAL to do post-init configuration
 * 4) Core NCI stack calls pre_discover() to allow HAL to prepare for RF discovery
 * 5) Core NCI stack starts discovery through calls to write()
 * 6) Core NCI stack stops discovery through calls to write() (e.g. screen turns off)
 * 7) Core NCI stack calls pre_discover() to prepare for RF discovery (e.g. screen turned back on)
 * 8) Core NCI stack starts discovery through calls to write()
 * ...
 * ...
 * 9) Core NCI stack calls close()
