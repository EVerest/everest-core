Module Configuration
====================
| **can_device**: *string* <optional>
| *default: "can0"*
|  CAN interface name
| **module_addresses**: *string* <optional>
| *default: ""*
|  Module Addresses to use. Set to "0" for broadcast. Make sure to connect only one PSU on the CAN bus in broadcast mode, otherwise it will charge at a too high current (as every module will produce the full current the EV requests!) If you have multiple PSUs, use individual addresses and list them comma separated, e.g. "1,2". Then it will share the current between these PSUs.
| **group_address**: *integer* <optional>
| *default: 0*
|  Group address/dial setting. Use this if your PSUs using automatic allocation of the addresses. If you have multiple PSUs, set this number in accordance with the group dial setting of the PSUs you want to use. Check the PSU manual for details but the DIAL is sometimes in format 8421 (left MSB and right LSB). Can't use module addresses and group address at the same time, if both are set, the module addresses will be used.
| **device_connection_timeout_s**: *integer* <optional>
| *default: 15*
|  Timeout in seconds to wait for a module to respond before considering it offline. CRITICAL SAFETY: Must be > 10s (module internal timeout) to prevent overcurrent risk. Recommended: 15s.
| **conversion_efficiency_export**: *number* <optional>
| *default: 0.95*
|  Conversion efficiency of the export mode.
| **controller_address**: *integer* <optional>
| *default: 240*
|  Controller address defaults to 0xF0.
