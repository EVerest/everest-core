  title: "Basecamp API definition for the implementation of over voltage monitoring"
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >-
    API for basecamp for over voltage monitoring.

    This BaseCamp API defines an fast over voltage monitoring device according
    to IEC61851-23:2023 6.3.1.106.2 for DC charging. An emergency shutdown needs to be triggered
    if the DC output voltage is above the limit of Table 103 for 9ms. The actual shutdown needs
    to be handled in a lower layer outside of BaseCamp, but via this API the
    correct voltage limit are set at the start of the session and the monitoring is stopped at the
    end of the session. The over voltage error should be reported after the actual
    shutdown was already performed.
    Once an over voltage error was raised, it should only be cleared when the reset_over_voltage_error command is called.
    All other errors should be raised/cleared when they occur/are no longer active immediately.

        The voltage measurment should be published in regular intervals,
        e.g. 1 second. It is not  used to compare it with the overvoltage threshold
        setting in EVerest, that has to be done in the OVM device itself.
        It will only used to validate that the OVM and the IMD see the same voltage
        to ensure they are correctly wired to the same charging port.
        If it is not availble in hardware, do not publish the voltage_measurement_V at all.

        - DeviceFault: The over voltage monitoring device is no longer functional.
        - CommunicationFault: The communication to the hardware or underlying driver is lost or has errors.
        - VendorError: Vendor specific error code. Will stop charging session.
        - VendorWarning: Vendor specific error code. Charging may continue.

    Error:
      description: >-
        Errors for the power_supply_DC interface.
        Except for VendorWarning, all error codes will stop the charging session.
        During all errors, follow the commands for setMode and setVoltageCurrent from EvseManager.
        If they cannot be sent to the hardware, cache the last values received.
        Once the PSU is back on-line (e.g. after a CommunicationFault), set the last mode and voltage/current
        values and only after that clear the error.
