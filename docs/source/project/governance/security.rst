Supported Versions
==================

Since the beginning of 2026 we are releasing versions of EVerest with a cadence of six months.
The specifics of this release process are outlined in the :ref:`Release Documentation <project-release-and-versioning>`.

Reporting a Vulnerability
=========================

If you found a vulnerability, we are super keen and grateful to get the details. Please use this private mailing list to let us know:
everest-security@lists.lfenergy.org

Please DON'T use the publicly visible issue reporting functionality from GitHub!
Alternatively you can use the "Report a vulnerability" feature on Github
which should be enabled in all repositories.
For example for everest-core you can find this here: https://github.com/EVerest/everest-core/security

We try to monitor this list and respond every working day, but in initial respond time should not go beyond 7 days.
Please provide us with your estimation of the severity of your finding. Every other information on how to exploit it as well as everything
else you could provide is helpful.
