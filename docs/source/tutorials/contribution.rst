Contributing to EVerest
#######################

Assuming you want to contribute to the source code of EVerest, this tutorial
will help finding your way through the standard process.

The following steps are involved, which we will walk through in this tutorial
to get the details:

* Have an idea for EVerest and creating an according issue,
* promote a first high-level explanation of your idea and describing a
  possible way to implement a solution,
* discuss with responsible core developers and the community,
* prepare your development environment and start developing,
* give intermediate information in the EVerest live calls and
* present the final work and update all relevant EVerest documents.

Let's get started!


Step 0: Before you start
========================

This tutorial assumes that you already had some experience with EVerest.
For example, you did some simulation tests based on our beginner guides
or you even used EVerest for a real-world hardware project already.

An additional great practice is to already have created an account for the
main EVerest community platform, Zulip.

Also consider to attend some of the live talks like the working groups.


Step 1: A new idea means a new issue
====================================

Let's assume that you have worked with EVerest's OCPP features but you noticed
that the local cost calculation for OCPP 2.1 is still missing.

What a great idea to implement that.

One important rule though:
For every idea / feature, we will have to create a GitHub issue first as the
core developers and the EVerest community could have some additional opinions
or even suggestions for the implementation of your idea.
Let them get the chance to express their views on a dedicated issue page.

Step 1.1: Create a new issue
----------------------------

Look for the repository that fits your feature idea.
In our case, the `libocpp <https://github.com/EVerest/libocpp>`_ repository
would be a great idea.

On the GitHub page, click on the "Issues" tab.

Before creating a new one, please look for an existing issue that would fit
your topic.
Also use the search function of GitHub.
Eventually somebody else already had the same idea and there already was some
discussion about it.

If there is no existing issue, create a new one.
Choose "New issue" on the issues page, which will show a dialog with some
options.
In our case, "Feature request" will be the right option to choose.

Give your new issue a nice title and fill out the form.
The more information you can give about your feature idea and the possible
solution, the better for core developers to understand and give input to your
contribution.

Step 1.2: Let the discussion happen
