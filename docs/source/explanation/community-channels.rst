Meet the EVerest Community
##########################

There are quite some options to get involved in the EVerest community.
The following sections will guide your way.


Deep tech discussions: Zulip
****************************

The main area for tech talk and discussing questions is Zulip:

`EVerest Zulip <https://lfenergy.zulipchat.com/>`_

You can find chat channels there for different topics all around EVerest.

Feel free to drop your own questions and dive into the communication with
other EVerest enthusiasts.

Read the README channel in Zulip for more information about the different
channels.


Live calls by core developers: Working groups
*********************************************

We also have online video meetings for a more personal way of exchange.

The General EVerest Welcome Call is a format since the beginning of 2025.
If these documentation pages at hand leave some questions open about how the
EVerest community works, and you want to clarify that in person, you can join
us in a weekly (non-technical) meeting.

We can answer question all around the EVerest community and show you the way
to go with your specific scenario.

The General EVerest Welcome Call is each Tuesday at 11am CE(S)T.

For joining us in the Zoom meetings, find the links in the official
`EVerest event calendar <https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/everest?view=week>`_.

Further live meetings we regularly have are the working group meetings.
In the working groups, developers meet for exchanging the status quo of
dedicated EVerest projects and topics.

The working groups could change over time depending on the current needs of
the community.
Currently, we have the following working groups:

* Car Communication (car/charger communication with topics ISO 15118, EXI, SLAC, CHAdeMO etc)
* Cloud Communication (communication between charger and backends in cloud with topics OCPP 1.6, 2.0.1, 2.1 etc)
* Energy Management
* MCS (Megawatt Charging System)

The links to the Zoom meetings of the working groups can also be found in the
`official EVerest event calendar <https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/everest?view=week>`_.

If you work on a topic that does not fit in the current list of working
groups, you can ask in Zulip or in the General Call for finding like-minded
people and suggest creating a new working group.

You might want to join the working group chat channels in Zulip.
See the “Zulip chat” section above to see how to get there!


Tech discussion for email lovers
********************************

Another way to connect to the steadily growing EVerest community is
the mailing list.

Traffic decreased steadily since the introduction of Zulip, but if email is
your favourite choice of communicating, here's the way to go.

We have set up two separate mailing lists:

The most important one is the announcement list.
Important news or events all around EVerest are shared there.

Subscribe here:
`EVerest announcement list <https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/everest-announce>`_ .

Optionally, you can subscribe to the mailing list with more tech focus:
`EVerest mailing list <https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/everest>`_ .


Beyond EVerest: Special Interest Group
**************************************

Linux Foundation Energy (LFE) is growing.
As the EVerest project (and all other LFE projects) have several connecting
points to other projects in the same field, a Special Interest Group (SIG) has
been created for

* exchanging thoughts and experiences,
* share best practices,
* discuss industry trends and
* tackle challenges together.

If you work in the field of EV charging and you are interested in open source
software / projects, join the SIG calls.
They are free to access and open to all interested parties.

Join the mailing list:
`https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/ev-charging-sig <https://lists.lfenergy.org/g/ev-charging-sig>`_

Directly access via Zoom:
