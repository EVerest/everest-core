    description: >-
      Event stream from ControlPilot signal/relais.

      A-F: CP states as defined in IEC61851-1
      PowerOn: Hardware confirms that contactors switched on correctly (typically mirror contacts indicated successful switch on)
      PowerOff: Hardware confirms that contactors switched off correctly and are not welded (typically mirror contacts indicated successful switch off)

      EvseReplugStarted: Special testing sequence: virtual replugging started
      EvseReplugFinished: Special testing sequence: virtual replugging stopped
      Disconnected: Only used on EV side: Not connected to a charging station. Do not use on EVSE side.
