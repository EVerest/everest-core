  ChargerInformation:
    description: >-
      Type holding (mostly static) meta information about the whole charger.
      Note: Vendor and manufacturer refer here to the very same company - it is the brand
      which appears physically on the device label and/or which is shown on device's web
      frontend, in UPnP etc.
      We use both terms here to differentiate the different usages - with legal suffix, or without.
      This is why e.g. no `vendor_url` field is defined - it would be the very same
      as `manufacturer_url`.
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false
    required:
      - vendor
      - model
    properties:
      vendor:
        description: >-
          Name of vendor, not including any legal form. Is typically used with `model` to
          form a unique product name aka `vendor` + `single whitespace` + `model`.
          Example: Pionix
        type: string
      model:
        description: >-
          A human-friendly name of the model, aka the product name; without vendor name,
          without any device specific data/numbers (serial numbers/MAC addresses).
          Example: BelayBox
        type: string
      chargepoint_serial:
        description: >-
          The traditional serial number as string. It does not necessarily consist of digits only.
          Usually, this serial appears also on a label on the device.
          Example: SH4CAWN00123
        type: string
      chargebox_serial:
        description: >-
          The serial number of the controller as string (if any).
          It does not necessarily consist of digits only.
          Example: CB123456
        type: string
      friendly_name:
        description: >-
          A string with can be used to display the device eg. in network listings/enumerations.
          As mentioned above, this could typically consist of eg.:
          `vendor` + `single whitespace` + `model` + ` [` + `serial` + `]`
          Printers or wifi access points for example often use the last digits of their
          MAC address instead of the serial number to allow users to differentiate multiple
          instances in the network.
        type: string
      manufacturer:
        description: >-
          The name of the vendor, but this may include the legal form.
          Typically used in product property lists or as text for the following URL.
        type: string
      manufacturer_url:
        description: >-
          An URL to the vendor website, ideally not a deep link so that it is available for
          the whole product lifetime.
        type: string
      model_url:
        description: >-
          An URL to the model website (if any); as above, ideally not a deep link.
        type: string
      model_number:
        description: >-
          A model number as string (if any).
        type: string
      model_revision:
        description: >-
          A model or product revision string. Very often this is not defined for the first one
          so that users of this variable should consider reasonable fallback/default
          values. For later product/model revisions, this is typically printed also on a device
          label so that customers can refer to it when e.g requesting product support.
        type: string
      board_revision:
        description: >-
          The revision (aka version) of the internal (main) PCB, ie. that one with
          the CPU running the EVerest system.
        type: string
      firmware_version:
        description: >-
          A string containing the current running firmware version of the complete system.
          This is typically not the EVerest version itself, but a firmware version which appears
          e.g. on the web frontend and as part of the filenames the customer can download from
          the manufacturer's website.
          This is the only property which is typically not static for the product lifetime,
          but determined at runtime.
        type: string
