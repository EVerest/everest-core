  StopTransactionReason:
    description: >-

        Disabled: Signaled when the EVSE is disabled (e.g. after a disable command)
        SessionStarted: Signaled when a session has been started. A session has been started either when an EV is plugged in or the user has been authorized to start a transaction (e.g. after an authorize command)
        TransactionStarted: Signaled when a transaction has been started. Transaction starts at the point that all conditions for charging are met: EV is connected and user has been authorized.
        AuthRequired: Signaled when an EVSE needs authorization to start a transaction
        ChargingPausedEV: Signaled when charging is paused by the EV
        ChargingPausedEVSE: Signaled when charging is paused by the EVSE
        TransactionFinished: Signaled when the transaction finished. Transaction finishes at the point where one of the preconditions for charging irrevocably becomes false: When a user swipes to stop the transaction and the stop is authorized.
        SessionFinished: Signaled when the transaction finished. Session finishes at the point that the EVSE is available again (no cable plugged)
        Error: Signaled when an error occured
        PermanentFault: Signaled when there is a permanent fault at the EVSE
        ReservationStart: Signaled when a reservation starts
        ReservationEnd: Signaled when a reservation ends
