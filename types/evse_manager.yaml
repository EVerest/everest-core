        Disabled: Signaled when the EVSE is disabled (e.g. after a disable command)
        SessionStarted: Signaled when a session has been started. A session has been started either when an EV is plugged in or the user has been authorized to start a transaction (e.g. after an authorize command)
        AuthRequired: Signaled when an EVSE needs authorization to start a transaction
        TransactionStarted: Signaled when a transaction has been started. Transaction starts at the point that all conditions for charging are met: EV is connected and user has been authorized
        PrepareCharging: EVSE started to prepare for charging. DC: CableCheck, PreCharge, PowerDelivery. AC: wait for the car to proceed to state C/D

        SessionFinished: Session finishes at the point that the EVSE is available again (no cable plugged)
        Error: Signaled when an error occured. An error doesnt prevent further charging operations.
