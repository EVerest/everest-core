        PowerLoss: Complete loss of power
        Reboot: A locally initiated reset/reboot occurred

        MasterPass: The transaction was stopped using a token with a MasterPassGroupId.
        OvercurrentFault: A larger than intended electric current has occurred
        PowerQuality: Quality of power too low, e.g. voltage too low/high, phase imbalance, etc.
        SOCLimitReached: Electric vehicle has reported reaching a locally enforced maximum battery State of Charge (SOC)
        StoppedByEV: The transaction was stopped by the EV
        TimeLimitReached: EV charging session reached a locally enforced time limit

  SessionEventEnum:
    description: >-
      Session Event enum
        Authorized: Signaled when the EVSE is authorized for charging
        Deauthorized: Signaled when the EVSE is not authorized for charging (anymore)
        Enabled: Signaled when the EVSE is enabled (e.g. after an enable command)
        Disabled: Signaled when the EVSE is disabled (e.g. after a disable command)
        SessionStarted: Signaled when a session has been started. A session has been started either when an EV is plugged in or the user has been authorized to start a transaction (e.g. after an authorize command)
        AuthRequired: Signaled when an EVSE needs authorization to start a transaction
        TransactionStarted: Signaled when a transaction has been started. Transaction starts at the point that all conditions for charging are met: EV is connected and user has been authorized
        PrepareCharging: EVSE started to prepare for charging. DC: CableCheck, PreCharge, PowerDelivery. AC: wait for the car to proceed to state C/D
        ChargingStarted: DC: CurrentDemand has started. AC: Auth is ok and car requested power (state C/D)
        ChargingPausedEV: Signaled when charging is paused by the EV
        ChargingPausedEVSE: Signaled when charging is paused by the EVSE
        ChargingResumed: Charging has resumed from a pause
        StoppingCharging: EVSE has started to stop the charging process. DC: CurrentDemand has finished, now doing WeldingCheck etc, AC: Wait for car to return to state B or A
        ChargingFinished: Charging is finished. Essentially the same as TransactionFinished, but emitted for clarity
        TransactionFinished: Signaled when the transaction finished. Transaction finishes at the point where one of the preconditions for charging irrevocably becomes false: When a user swipes to stop the transaction and the stop is authorized.
        SessionFinished: Session finishes at the point that the EVSE is available again (no cable plugged)
        Error: Signaled when an error occured. An error doesnt prevent further charging operations.
        AllErrorsCleared: Signalled when all errors are cleared
        PermanentFault: Signaled when there is a permanent fault at the EVSE. A permanent fault prevents further charging operations
        ReservationStart: Signaled when a reservation starts
        ReservationEnd: Signaled when a reservation ends
        ReplugStarted: Signaled when the EVSE Manager virtually replugs without interrupting the session or transaction
        ReplugFinished: Signaled when the virtual replug process has finished
        PluginTimeout: Signaled when an EV has been Plugged in but no authorization is present within specified ConnectionTimeout
