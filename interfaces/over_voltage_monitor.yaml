  This interface defines a fast over voltage monitoring device according
  to IEC61851-23:2023 6.3.1.106.2 for DC charging. An emergency shutdown needs to be triggered
  if the DC output voltage is above the limit of Table 103 for 9ms. The actual shutdown needs
  to be handled in a lower layer outside of EVerest, but this interface sets the 
  correct voltage limit at the start of the session and stops monitoring at the 
  end of the session. The over voltage error should be reported after the actual
  shutdown was already performed.
  Once an over voltage error was raised, it should only be cleared when the reset_over_voltage_error command is called.
  All other errors should be raised/cleared when they occur/are no longer active immediately.
cmds:
  start:
    description: >-
      Start over voltage monitoring
    arguments:
      over_voltage_limit_V:
        description: >-
          Specifies the over voltage threshold [V] (based on IEC61851-23:2023 Table 103)
          An emergency shutdown should be triggered if the DC output voltage is higher 
          than this value.
        type: number
  stop:
    description: >-
      Stop over voltage monitoring at the end of the power transfer.
  reset_over_voltage_error:
    description: >-
      Resets the detection logic to allow for new charging session after an over voltage error occurred.
      This should clear the over voltage error.
      If monitoring is still active, it should be stopped.
