  This interface provides functions for a random delay feature as required by the UK smart charging regulations
  The logic whether to use a random delay or not is not included in EvseManager, a different module can use this
  interface to enable/disable the feature during runtime and cancel a running random delay.
  This always applies to all connectors of this EVSE.
  By default, on start up, random delays are disabled.
