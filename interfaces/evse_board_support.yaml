  This interface defines the board support driver for AC or DC minimal power path: ControlPilot,
  output contactors. 
  Other components of the power path such as IMD(DC)/RCD(AC)/Connector Lock etc have their own interfaces.

    arguments:
      three_phases:
        description: 'true: Three phases enabled, false: only single phase'
        type: boolean

        type: string
  get_hw_capabilities:
    description: >-
      Get Hardware capability/limits. For AC these are the limits of the power path (e.g. relais etc). 
      For DC, these are the limits for the AC input of the ACDC converter stack, i.e. the complete AC input.
      Note that DC output limits are reported by the DC power supply itself.

      $ref: /evse_board_support#/HardwareCapabilities
  enable:
    description: >-
      Enables or disables the charging port. Typically disabled results in control
      pilot state F. It must not accept cars for new charging sessions if disabled.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: 'True: enabled, false: disabled.'
        type: boolean
  pwm_on:
    description: Turns PWM on with duty cycle (in percent)
    arguments:

        description: PWM duty cycle (>0, <100)
        type: number
        minimum: 0
        maximum: 100
  pwm_off:

  pwm_F:
    description: Turns PWM off with Error F (constant negative voltage)
  allow_power_on:
    description: >-
      Sets allow_power_on flag. If false, Relais must never be switched
      on.

  ac_switch_three_phases_while_charging:
    description: >-
      Optional, in case of doubt do not implement. Report in hardware_capabilites if this command is supported.
      This command switches between one and three phase operation during an active charging session.
      Some cars can be permanently destroyed by that, so the bsp needs to implement a special sequence for the switching.
      The exact sequence can be defined by the BSP, but one example would be a C2->C1->B1->F->B1->B2->C2 or similar.
      Use with caution.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: 'True: switch to 3ph, False: switch to 1ph'
        type: boolean
  evse_replug:
    description: >-
      Optional, in case of doubt do not implement.
      Special command initiate a virtual replug sequence without restarting
      session. Emits a EvseReplugStarted event if supported and started. BSP will
      take care to not emit other events such as CarPluggedIn/Out during that time.
      Once finished it will emit a EvseReplugFinished. This is mainly for testing purposes,
      don't implement for production use.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: Time in ms for the duration of the replug sequence
        type: integer
  ac_read_pp_ampacity:
    description: >-
      Read the current carrying capacity of the connected cable in ampere for AC charging
      with a socket. This function will be used by EvseManager to get the PP value at 
      a distinct time. You should also publish the var pp_ampacity whenever the PP ampacity reading changes
      to signal changes e.g. during the charging time.
      This has no meaning for DC or AC charging with a fixed attached cable, it does not 
      need to be implemented and the returned value is not used in those cases.
    result:
      description: Returns the current carrying capacity of the connected cable
      type: object
      $ref: /board_support_common#/ProximityPilot
  ac_set_overcurrent_limit_A:
    description: >-
      Many chargers implement a fast over current shutdown directly in the hardware that triggers if the EV draws more current than
      the PWM allows.
      If the hardware does not have this functionality, just ignore this command. Do not use it to set the PWM duty cycle.
      Otherwise this command reports a value that should be used for the overcurrent detection. 
      A margin needs to be added to avoid false triggers. Do not use the PWM duty cycle to infer the current limit in the BSP,
      as this will not work with HLC.

  capabilities:
    description: >-
      Hardware capabilities/limits. Initially EvseManager will call get_hw_capabilities once to fetch the limits and caches the limits internally.
      The BSP module does not have to publish this variable at all, then the initially fetched capabilities will be used.
      The BSP may publish this variable to update limits in case they change during runtime, e.g. if the maximum current changes because the hardware gets too hot.

  ac_pp_ampacity:
    description: >-
      Current carrying capacity of the connected cable in ampere for AC charging
      with a socket. Publish whenever it changes.
      This has no meaning for DC or AC charging with a fixed attached cable, it does not 
      need to be implemented and the returned value is not used in those cases.
