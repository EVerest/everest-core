  This interface defines the board support driver for AC or DC minimal power path: ControlPilot,
  output contactors. 
  Other components of the power path such as IMD(DC)/RCD(AC)/Connector Lock etc have their own interfaces.

    arguments:
      three_phases:
        description: 'true: Three phases enabled, false: only single phase'

        type: string
  get_hw_capabilities:
    description: >-
      Get Hardware capability/limits. For AC these are the limits of the power path (e.g. relais etc). 
      For DC, these are the limits for the AC input of the ACDC converter stack, i.e. the complete AC input.
      Note that DC output limits are reported by the DC power supply itself.

  enable:
    description: >-
      Enables or disables the charging port. Typically disabled results in control
      pilot state F. It must not accept cars for new charging sessions if disabled.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: 'True: enabled, false: disabled.'
        type: boolean
  pwm_on:

  pwm_off:

  pwm_F:
    description: Turns PWM off with Error F (constant negative voltage)
  allow_power_on:
    description: >-
      Sets allow_power_on flag. If false, Relais must never be switched
      on.

  ac_switch_three_phases_while_charging:
    description: >-
      Special command to force switching between one and three phases while
      charging is active. HW must go through some special sequence to ensure safe
      operation.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: 'True: switch to 3ph, False: switch to 1ph'
        type: boolean
  evse_replug:
    description: >-
      Special command initiate a virtual replug sequence without restarting
      session. Emits a EvseReplugStarted event if supported and started. BSP will
      take care to not emit other events such as CarPluggedIn/Out during that time.
      Once finished it will emit a EvseReplugFinished. This is for testing purposes,
      don't implement for production use.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: Time in ms for the duration of the replug sequence
        type: integer
  ac_read_pp_ampacity:
    description: >-
      Read the current carrying capacity of the connected cable in ampere for AC charging
      with a socket. This function will be used by EvseManager to get the PP value at 
      a distinct time. You should also publish the var pp_ampacity whenever the PP ampacity reading changes
      to signal changes e.g. during the charging time.
      This has no meaning for DC or AC charging with a fixed attached cable, it does not 
      need to be implemented and the returned value is not used in those cases.
    result:
      description: Returns the current carrying capacity of the connected cable
      type: object
      $ref: /board_support_common#/ProximityPilot
  ac_set_overcurrent_limit_A:
    description: >-
      Sets the limit that should be used for over current detection in the BSP.
      Do not use this to set PWM, use this value only for fast OC detection in the MCU.
      This will set the actual charging value, so for 16A charging you will get 16A here,
      you will need to add a margin in the BSP to avoid false triggers.

  pp_ampacity:
    description: >-
      Current carrying capacity of the connected cable in ampere for AC charging
      with a socket. Publish whenever it changes.
      This has no meaning for DC or AC charging with a fixed attached cable, it does not 
      need to be implemented and the returned value is not used in those cases.
