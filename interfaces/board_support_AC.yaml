  enable:
    description: >-
      Enables or disables the EVSE. Typically disabled results in control
      pilot state F. It must not accept cars for new charging sessions if disabled.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: 'True: enabled, false: disabled.'
        type: boolean

        maximum: 1
  pwm_off:
    description: Turns PWM off (constant high voltage)
  pwm_F:
    description: Turns PWM off with Error F (constant negative voltage)
  allow_power_on:
    description: >-
      Sets allow_power_on flag. If false, Relais must never be switched
      on.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: 'True: allow power on, false: do not allow power on.'

    result:
      description: Returns true if unlocking sequence was successfully executed
      type: boolean
  switch_three_phases_while_charging:
    description: >-
      Special command to force switching between one and three phases while
      charging is active. HW must go through some special sequence to ensure safe
      operation.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: 'True: switch to 3ph, False: switch to 1ph'
        type: boolean
  evse_replug:
    description: >-
      Special command initiate a virtual replug sequence without restarting
      session. Emits a EvseReplugStarted event if supported and started. BSP will
      take care to not emit other events such as CarPluggedIn/Out during that time.
      Once finished it will emit a EvseReplugFinished.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: Time in ms for the duration of the replug sequence
        type: integer
  read_pp_ampacity:
    description: >-
      Read the current carrying capacity of the connected cable in ampere.
      In case of a fixed cable the configured maximum current the hardware can handle will be reported.
    result:
      description: Returns the current carrying capacity of the connected cable in ampere
      type: number
