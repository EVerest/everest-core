  This interface defines the evse manager. An evse manager represents the
  charging kernel of one physical connector.
cmds:
  get_evse:
    description: Call to get information about the EVSE including its connectors
    result:
      description: Object that contains information of the EVSE including its connectors
      type: object
      $ref: /evse_manager#/Evse
  enable_disable:
    description: Enables or disables the evse
    arguments:
      connector_id:

        $ref: /evse_manager#/EnableDisableSource
    result:
      description: >-
        Returns true if evse is enabled after the command, false if it is disabled.
        This may not be the same value as the request, since there may be a higher priority request
        from another source that is actually deciding whether it is enabled or disabled.
      type: boolean
  authorize_response:
    description: >-
      Reports the result of an authorization request to the EvseManager. 
      Contains the provided_token for which authorization was requested and
      the validation_result
    arguments:

      Call to signals that EVSE is not further authorized to start a transaction
      (e.g. on a connection_timeout)
  reserve:
    description: >-
      Call to signal that EVSE is reserved. This can be used to e.g. change
      the color of the HMI LEDs to indicate reservation.
    arguments:
      reservation_id:
        description: >-
          The reservation id (should be added to the TransactionStarted
          event)

  set_faulted:

      Sets the evse manager to faulted externally. It may also switch to
      faulted itself if it detects an internal error.
  pause_charging:
    description: Call to signal EVSE to pause charging
    result:
      description: >-
        Returns true if successfully paused or was already in paused_by_evse

  resume_charging:
    description: Call to signal EVSE to resume charging
    result:
      description: >-
        Returns true if resume was successful, false otherwise (e.g. resuming
        a car pause won't work)
      type: boolean
  stop_transaction:
    description: >-
      Stops transaction and cancels charging externally, charging can only
      be resumed by replugging car. EVSE will also stop transaction automatically
      e.g. on disconnect, so this only needs to be called if the transaction should
      end before.
    arguments:
      request:
        description: Request to stop the transaction.
        type: object
        $ref: /evse_manager#/StopTransactionRequest
    result:
      description: Returns true if successful
      type: boolean
  force_unlock:
    description: >-
      Forces connector to unlock connector now. During normal operation, connector
      will be locked/unlocked in the correct sequence. Do not use this function except
      if explicitly requested by e.g. management cloud.
    arguments:
      connector_id:
        description: Specifies the ID of the connector that should be unlocked
        type: integer
    result:
      description: Returns true if unlocking sequence was successfully executed
      type: boolean
  set_external_limits:
    description: Set additional external energy flow limits at this node.
    arguments:
      value:
        description: UUID of node that this limit applies to

  switch_three_phases_while_charging:
    description: Switch three phases while charging
    arguments:
      three_phases:

        type: boolean
    result:
      description: Returns success or error code
      type: string
      $ref: /evse_manager#/SwitchThreePhasesWhileChargingResult
  set_get_certificate_response:
    description: >-
      CertificateInstallationRes/CertificateUpdateRes - Set the new/updated Contract Certificate (including the certificate chain)
      and the corresponding encrypted private key. Should be forwared to EVCC.
      This is an async response to a previously published iso15118_certificate_request
    arguments:

        type: object

  external_ready_to_start_charging:
    description: >-
      There are situations where another module needs to do some initialization after evse manager is in principle ready to start charging.
      This command can be used (optimally in combination with a configuration option) to delay charging ready until the external module is done with its initialization
