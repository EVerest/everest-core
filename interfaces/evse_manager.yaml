  This interface defines the evse manager. An evse manager represents the
  charging kernel of one physical connector.
cmds:
  get_evse:
    description: Call to get information about the EVSE including its connectors
    result:
      description: Object that contains information of the EVSE including its connectors
      type: object
      $ref: /evse_manager#/Evse
  enable_disable:
    description: Enables or disables the evse. Turns off PWM with error F. Charging is only possible if an EVSE is enabled.
    arguments:
      connector_id:
        description: Specifies the ID of the connector to enable. If 0, the whole EVSE should be enabled
        type: integer
      cmd_source:
        description: Source of the enable command
        type: object
        $ref: /evse_manager#/EnableDisableSource
    result:
      description: >-
        Returns true if evse is enabled after the command, false if it is disabled.
        This may not be the same value as the request, since there may be a higher priority request
        from another source that is actually deciding whether it is enabled or disabled.
      type: boolean
  authorize_response:
    description: >-
      Reports the result of an authorization request to the EvseManager.
      Contains the provided_token for which authorization was requested and
      the validation_result
    arguments:
      provided_token:
        description: The token for which authorization was requested
        type: object
        $ref: /authorization#/ProvidedIdToken
      validation_result:
        description: The validation result
        type: object
        $ref: /authorization#/ValidationResult
  withdraw_authorization:
    description: >-
      Call to signals that EVSE is not further authorized to start a transaction
      (e.g. on a connection_timeout)
  reserve:
    description: >-
      Call to signal that EVSE is reserved. This can be used to e.g. change
      the color of the HMI LEDs to indicate reservation.
    arguments:
      reservation_id:
        description: >-
          The reservation id (should be added to the TransactionStarted event). Set this to a negative value if there is
          no specific reservation id for this evse but the evse should still move to a Reserved state because of total
          global reservations.
        type: integer
    result:
      description: Returns true if the EVSE accepted the reservation, else false.
      type: boolean
  cancel_reservation:
    description: Call to signal that EVSE is not reserved anymore
  pause_charging:
    description: Call to signal EVSE to pause charging
    result:
      description: >-
        Returns true if successfully paused or was already in paused_by_evse
        mode
      type: boolean
  resume_charging:
    description: Call to signal EVSE to resume charging
    result:
      description: >-
        Returns true if resume was successful, false otherwise (e.g. resuming
        a car pause won't work)
      type: boolean
  stop_transaction:
    description: >-
      Stops transaction and cancels charging externally, charging can only
      be resumed by replugging car. EVSE will also stop transaction automatically
      e.g. on disconnect, so this only needs to be called if the transaction should
      end before.
    arguments:
      request:
        description: Request to stop the transaction.
        type: object
        $ref: /evse_manager#/StopTransactionRequest
    result:
      description: Returns true if successful
      type: boolean
  force_unlock:
    description: >-
      Forces connector to unlock connector now. During normal operation, connector
      will be locked/unlocked in the correct sequence. Do not use this function except
      if explicitly requested by e.g. management cloud.
    arguments:
      connector_id:
        description: Specifies the ID of the connector that should be unlocked
        type: integer
    result:
      description: >-
        Returns true if unlocking command was accepted, or false if it is not supported.
        It does not reflect the success/failure of the actual unlocking.
        If unlocking fails, the connector_lock interface shall raise an error asynchronously.
      type: boolean
  external_ready_to_start_charging:
    description: >-
      There are situations where another module needs to do some initialization after evse manager is in principle ready to start charging.
      This command can be used (optimally in combination with a configuration option) to delay charging ready until the external module is done with its initialization
    result:
      description: Returns true if the signal was used by the evse manager implementation
      type: boolean
  set_plug_and_charge_configuration:
    description: >-
      Sets the configuration required for ISO15118 to handle contract authorization.
    arguments:
      plug_and_charge_configuration:
        description: The plug and charge configuration object
        type: object
        $ref: /evse_manager#/PlugAndChargeConfiguration
  update_allowed_energy_transfer_modes:
    description: >-
      Sets the supported energy transfer mode for ISO15118. It is expected that this command will update the ISO15118
      software stack to only propose the list of allowed_energy_transfer_modes presented in this message.
      If a transaction is already in progress, it is expected that this triggers a service renegotiation.
      If no HLC is present, this will be accepted, but do nothing.
    arguments:
      allowed_energy_transfer_modes:
        description: >-
          The list of supported energy transfer modes. It cannot be empty as we need to propose something
          to the EV.
