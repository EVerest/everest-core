  Interface for power supplies used for DC charging

  Implementation guidelines for this interface:
  1) During start up of the driver, publish capabilities as soon as they are available, ideally in ready() function.
     The charging logic in EvseManager will not allow any charging until it receives the capabilities at least once.
     Capabilities may be published at any later point in time to update the values. This may happen if they e.g. change due
     to thermal derating etc. If a charging session is active when the update is received,
     only power/current limits will be applied immediately. All other values will become active at the next charging session.

  2) setMode/setVoltageCurrent commands should be executed on the hardware immediately. If this is not possible because an error is currently active
     (e.g. communication to the hardware is lost), the driver module shall cache the last mode and voltage/current settings.
     Once the PSU is back on-line (e.g. after a CommunicationFault), set the last mode and voltage/current value received and only after that clear the error.

  3) var voltage_current shall be published on regular intervals. The interval depends on the hardware, but it shall be at least once per second. If possible,
     update at e.g. 4 Hertz is recommended.
cmds:
  setMode:
    description: Set operation mode of the bidirectional DC power supply
    arguments:
      mode:
        description: Operation mode of power supply
        type: string
        $ref: /power_supply_DC#/Mode
      phase:
        description: >-
          Charging phase for this mode change. This information should normally not be needed by the power supply,
          as it should always just operate in CCCV mode. Some special setups however are handling CableCheck/PreCharge/Charge
          a little bit different internally.
