  This interface allows to control an OCPP service and set and get data from the OCPP service. It is designed
  to be used for both OCPP1.6 and OCPP2.0.1 module implementations. Therefore, the vars, commands and types
  are based more on the definitions of OCPP2.0.1, as this offers more flexibility and it is easier to transfer
  to the capabilities of OCPP1.6 than vice versa.
cmds:
  stop:
    description: >-
      Disconnects the websocket connection and stops the OCPP communication.
      No OCPP messages will be stored and sent after a restart.
    result:

      description: >-
        Returns true if the service could be stopped successfully, else
        false
  restart:
    description: >-
      Connects the websocket and enables OCPP communication after a previous
      stop call.

      type: boolean
      description: >-
        Returns true if the service could be restarted successfully, else
        false

  monitor_variables:
    description: >-
      Command to start monitoring the given ComponentVariable(s). Any of the provided
      configuration keys will be published on change by the CSMS.
      Consecutive calls of this operation will not override but extend the existing monitors.
      With OCPP1.6: This command can be used to monitor configuration keys
      With OCPP2.0.1: This command can be used to monitor any kind of variable in the device model storage
