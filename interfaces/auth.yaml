  set_master_pass_group_id:
    description: >-
      Sets the master pass group id. IdTokens that have this id as parent_id_token belong to the Master Pass Group. 
      This means they can stop any ongoing transaction, but cannot start transactions. This can, for example, be used by
      law enforcement personal to stop any ongoing transaction when an EV has to be towed away. If master_pass_group_id 
      is an empty string, it is not used.

      If both parameters are given, the granted authorization for the given EVSE will be withdrawn, if the placed
        id_token matches the given id_token
