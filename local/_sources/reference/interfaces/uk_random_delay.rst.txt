| This interface provides functions for a random delay feature as required by the UK smart charging regulations The logic whether to use a random delay or not is not included in EvseManager, a different module can use this interface to enable/disable the feature during runtime and cancel a running random delay. This always applies to all connectors of this EVSE. By default, on start up, random delays are disabled.
