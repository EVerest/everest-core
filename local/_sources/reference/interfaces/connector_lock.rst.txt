Errors

| **/errors/connector_lock** :
|  **ConnectorLockCapNotCharged** : The capacitor for connector lock motor failed to charge within expected time
|  **ConnectorLockUnexpectedOpen** : The connector lock feedback returns open while it should be closed
|  **ConnectorLockUnexpectedClose** : The connector lock feedback returns closed while it should be open
|  **ConnectorLockFailedLock** : The connector lock failed to lock (feedback still returns open)
|  **ConnectorLockFailedUnlock** : The connector lock failed to unlock (feedback still returns closed)
|  **MREC1ConnectorLockFailure** : Failure to lock or unlock connector on the vehicle side as per MREC definition. How should that be implemented? We can only find out about locking on the EVSE side, so we will use this error to report EVSE side lock failures. It is probably a mistake in the MREC definition.
|  **VendorError** : Vendor specific error code. Will stop charging session.
|  **VendorWarning** : Vendor specific error code. Charging may continue.
