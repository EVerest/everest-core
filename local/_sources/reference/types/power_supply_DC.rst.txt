Power supply DC types

.. _power_supply_DC-Mode:

| **Mode**: *string* 
|  Operation mode of power supply. Power supply delivers power in Export mode and draws power in Import mode.
|  enum:
|    - Off
|    - Export
|    - Import
|    - Fault

.. _power_supply_DC-ChargingPhase:

| **ChargingPhase**: *string* 
|  Charging phase of the current mode change. Other is used for e.g. switching it off or any other internal testing not related to real charging.
|  enum:
|    - Other
|    - CableCheck
|    - PreCharge
|    - Charging

.. _power_supply_DC-VoltageCurrent:

| **VoltageCurrent**: *object* 
|  Voltage (V) and Current (A) at the input/output of the power supply
|  properties:
|   **voltage_V**: *number* <required>
|    Voltage in V
|   **current_A**: *number* <required>
|    Current in A

.. _power_supply_DC-Capabilities:

| **Capabilities**: *object* 
|  Capabilities for this power supply.
|  properties:
|   **bidirectional**: *boolean* <required>
|    'true: support bidirectional energy flow, false: support only Export mode (output)'
|   **current_regulation_tolerance_A**: *number* <required>
|    Absolute magnitude of the regulation tolerance in Ampere
|   **peak_current_ripple_A**: *number* <required>
|    Peak-to-peak magnitude of the current ripple in Ampere
|   **max_export_voltage_V**: *number* <required>

|   **min_export_current_A**: *number* <required>
|    Minimum current limit that the power supply can set in Ampere
|   **max_import_voltage_V**: *number* <optional>
|    Maximum voltage that the power supply supports to import energy in Volt
|   **min_import_voltage_V**: *number* <optional>
|    Minimum voltage that the power supply requires to import energy in Volt
|   **max_import_current_A**: *number* <optional>
|    Maximum current that the power supply can output in Ampere
|   **min_import_current_A**: *number* <optional>
|    Minimum current limit that the power supply can set in Ampere
|   **max_export_power_W**: *number* <required>
|    Maximum export power that the power supply can output in Watt
|   **max_import_power_W**: *number* <optional>
|    Maximum import power that the power supply can sink in Watt
|   **conversion_efficiency_import**: *number* <optional>
|    Typical import efficiency used for energy management
